I’ve started the day filling two bugs with VS for Mac had written down last
week:

-   <https://bugzilla.xamarin.com/show_bug.cgi?id=60722> —the area to choose a
    device at toolbar wasn’t aligned with its corresponding touch one, but seems
    fixed and ready for 7.4!

-   <https://bugzilla.xamarin.com/show_bug.cgi?id=61249> —didn’t found any other
    one previously and particularly find this so useful: enabling direct search
    when pasting into CMD+. search bar

My mate Juan called me during the morning to show a small but nice refactoring
on the data layer of the app I was working on with them last week. He moved from
SQLite to [LiteDB](https://github.com/mbdavid/LiteDB), mostly because there was
no need for relational data, and SQLite was much more than actually needed.

I particularly moved my point of view during last years from having a shared
start-up project for incoming needs into spending a few days at the beginning
thinking what actually suits better for that current reality; for many reasons:
control over codebase, growing bottom-up, etc. It’s also a good approach in
life: going shopping because of a need instead of going shopping looking for
what we may need. The second always takes to unneeded stuff.
