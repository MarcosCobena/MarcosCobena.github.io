I’ve had the chance to add a small anim. in the page am working out. Which’s the
best easing function to fit? <http://easings.net>.

In the middle of the day [the disappearing caret
bug](https://bugzilla.xamarin.com/show_bug.cgi?id=61094) reproduced, and
followed Lluis steps to gather the IDE logs: (within VS for Mac) Help \> Open
Log Directory. I didn’t remember such this easy way to access every log in a
single folder, for the next time will have a look there before.
