On past Friday I found a bug in the screen was working related to how things are
stored in the DB —SQLite, actually. My mates had already done an Unit Testing
project, powered by xUnit, so have gone in and added a test which reproduces my
issue.

To be honest, I come from NUnit. Doing pair programming with a new workmate who
have joined the company today, we found out [this comparison
table](https://xunit.github.io/docs/comparisons.html) which answered to my
scaffolding questions —and I’ve liked a lot how xUnit makes things simpler, i.e.
using `IDisposable.Dispose()` for the tear down.

Talking about the disposing, we want the DB to be reset prior to any test run,
and initially dropped the DB file with `System.IO.File` helpers. Obviously this
went into a race condition where SQLite throws some read-only exceptions and
[this thread](https://github.com/oysteinkrog/SQLite.Net-PCL/issues/264) helped
us to solve it —a simple “VACUUM” and done.
