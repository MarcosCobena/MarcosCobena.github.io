I’ve been working during the last two weeks on a Getting Started package to
start future projects at DevsDNA. One of the things was asked for is supporting
.NET Standard 2.0 from the very beginning, to be ready for upcoming movements in
the .NET ecosystem.

Doing some tests with out beta version I stumbled upon lot of errors when adding
such to a Xamarin.iOS project —within a Forms solution— and decided to move into
a bug at Xamarin.iOS product:

<https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-macios/issues/3349>

Álex Soto’s confirmed this as a bug, and added a repro. project which will help
Xamarin guys to troubleshoot it easier. You probably won’t ever read this Álex
but thanks man!
