Keeping with the Azure class —AZR110 at Xamarin University— it got to a point
where following up in Mac was a little bit harder because of the lack the wizard
when adding new table controllers. This’ something you should do manually and I
was running out of time. It’d be so nice to have VS Mac version aligned to
Windows one in this aspect too.

Updating macOS High Sierra to 10.13.2 all my GitHub repos. set up with SSH
stopped working with a wonderful “authentication failed” message. It turned out
was as easy as adding again the keys:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    $ ssh-add -K ~/.ssh/YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY_NAME
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
