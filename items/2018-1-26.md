I’ve been recently playing a little bit with NuGet site and really liked its
simplicity. How packages are uploaded, updated, edited, etc. Today I discovered
that if you want to publish a prerelease version there’s no checkbox out there,
nor a complex system for this, but adding a suffix to your version:

`1.0.0-beta`

, for instance. Want to exit the beta world? Just remove that suffix and upload
it.

Aaand, take note deleting packages isn’t possible, the most you can achieve’s
unlisting them, which’s fine too.
