After some time with the idea in mind and some other more working on a
prototype, finally knowing when an app was built is an easy task. Since years
ago Iâ€™ve missed this:

-   (Customer) Hey thereâ€™s a bug here

-   (Me) OK, Iâ€™ll write it down to fix it; which version do you have?

-   (C) Mmm, where can I see that?

-   (M) Sorry you canâ€™t; when did you install the app?

-   (C) Donâ€™t remember, maybe a few days ago

-   (M) OK, thatâ€™s fine

And I tried to repro the bug on the latest, going backward until I found the
problematic commit. This was a typical scenario.

Today, you just initialize
[WhenTheAppWasBuilt](https://github.com/DevsDNA/WhenTheAppWasBuilt/) and:

-   (Customer) Hey thereâ€™s a bug here

-   (Me) OK, Iâ€™ll write it down to fix it; which version do you have?

-   (C) Mmm, where can I see that?

-   (M) Could you please shake your device?

-   (C) Sure, here says it was built on yesterday, at 3:06 am

-   (M) Perfect, you have the latest release from CD, thanks!

The idea is to enable WhenTheAppWasBuilt only while in development, and get rid
of it when going public.

My previous implementation contained a way to show the alert when the screen was
oriented as landscape, but was not consistent with apps only supporting portrait
mode. Also, I tried detecting native shake gestures but default Xamarin.iOSâ€™
`AppDelegate` doesnâ€™t inherit from `UIResponder`, and was a little mess too.

Thankfully found out [DeviceMotion
plug-in](https://github.com/rdelrosario/xamarin-plugins/tree/master/DeviceMotion)
(thanks Rendy and co.!) which allows my initial idea from a different
perspective.

In some other aspects, a few links I found handy after reinstalling Mac OS:

-   <https://github.com/codemillmatt/visual-studio-mac-launcher> â€”run it and
    youâ€™ll get a new/different VS app in your Dock

-   <https://www.android.com/filetransfer/> â€”easily move files between your
    computer and device, one way or another

-   <https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/android/getting_started/installation/android-emulator/xamarin-device-manager/>
    â€”I had read on Javi SuÃ¡rezâ€™s Twitter timeline it was useful so went on and
    tried it (mainly to avoid installing back Android Studio), and definitely
    recommend it to anyone ðŸ™‚ PS: itâ€™s not true VS 7.4 is a requirement, as
    stable oneâ€™s currently 7.3.\* and it just works

-   <https://gist.github.com/MarcosCobena/3b30e251249221478d1e17f02b6bab7b> â€”my
    Visual Studio for Mac custom key bindings, as feel much more confortable
    with them

Wow, quite productive day!
