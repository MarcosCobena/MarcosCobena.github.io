For the very first time I created an ASP.NET MVC project within VS for Mac and
published in Azure [everything from the
Mac](https://blog.xamarin.com/publish-azure-visual-studio-mac/). And, to be
honest, worked like a charm. After struggling with .NET Standard differences
between Windows and Mac this was a light of hope. (Just kidding.)

In other aspects, got an e-mail that [Xamarin just fixed the
bug](https://bugzilla.xamarin.com/show_bug.cgi?id=61120) I reported last month.
Sounds good!
