(Starting from today Iâ€™ll begin writting down What I Learned Today â€”WILT seems a
nice acronym.)

It seems Twilioâ€™s Xamarin components are somewhat abandoned: took 1.2.3 from
last days of Xamarin Components and crashes in Android, so back to 1.1; however,
canâ€™t consume 1.1 in iOS because is pre-Unified API, so am using 1.2.3 in this
platform. But have done my first calls in both! ðŸŽ‰
