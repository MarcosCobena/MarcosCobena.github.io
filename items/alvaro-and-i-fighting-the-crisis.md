[Kim](https://twitter.com/KimCausierTrans), a passionate translator who I met while working in [workINcompany](http://workincompany.com), has published an article where [Álvaro](https://twitter.com/reinoso_alvaro) and I answer a few questions regarding our app [¡Buenos días! aro](http://marcoscobena.com/apps/buenosdias/). I like that thing of "Crisis Busters". I guess it's needed nowadays to look for different ways to solve common problems -like the crisis we're going through, or living with- without loosing our smile.

Today I've noticed [my Dad](https://twitter.com/J_A_Cobena) uses the alarm included in the app to remember when to take the next pill... Such are the small things I find beauty on, and push me forward.

_Thanks so much Kim!_ And thanks too because the reason why the app looks native in terms of English language is due to your work. Without asking anything back, truth be told:
