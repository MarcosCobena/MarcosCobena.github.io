I don’t know whether this happens to others as well but I still see my-self
“discovering” new Xamarin.Forms' —actually in general— features as times goes
by. Quoted discovering mostly because [in this case] knew its existence;
however, didn’t apply it on a project of mine before. These all words to talk
about Control Templates.

In my project there was an initial effort of building the entire UI conforming
current design by those days, and we’ve reached a point where want to generally
increase its font size, but had lots of `FontSize=X` everywhere in XAML.

So, instead of just moving this into styles, I decided to move all that repeated
code into Control Templates, where the `TemplateBinding` asteroid came perfect
for me, as we bing stuff to current Page/VM.
