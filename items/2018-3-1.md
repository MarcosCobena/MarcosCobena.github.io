Today Iâ€™ve been back to collaborating with Wave Engine (yay!) Iâ€™ve been
assigned, along with my friend & mate Sergio, the easing curves component in
Gtk\#. Sergio had already done an amazing job by including a maths library which
calcs derivatives in a fraction of time. And the component already looks
gorgeous.

Oh, and filled/added more info on a few bugs in Visual Studio for Mac:

-   <https://bugzilla.xamarin.com/show_bug.cgi?id=60281> â€”ALT + Up/down arrows
    change spaces for tabs

-   <https://bugzilla.xamarin.com/show_bug.cgi?id=59973> â€”clicking on a search
    result doesnâ€™t take to the specific line in XAML files

I like a lot this product from Xamarin (have been using it since SharpDevelop
ðŸ‘´) and would like it to shine on those small things I find on my daily job. If
youâ€™re in the same position, go on and help your favorite products become even
better! Itâ€™s only a bit of your time compared with how much you gain using it.
