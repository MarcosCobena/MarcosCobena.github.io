As it uses to happen, I learned what Control Templates were during a big refactoring involving styles. When you're going through the screens designed, don't you realize there's a common pattern? If you do, try to group all those things shared into Control Templates, because will frame your pages letting such concentrate just in the inner content.

Conventions:

- Key: {Identifier}Template

In order to consume them, just add those at page's definition:

```xaml
<ContentPage 
    [...]
    ControlTemplate="{StaticResource FullScreenLoadingTemplate}">
```

This one's particularly handy, as can make any page loading-aware:

```xaml
<ControlTemplate x:Key="FullScreenLoadingTemplate">
    <AbsoluteLayout>

        <ContentPresenter
            AbsoluteLayout.LayoutFlags="All"
            AbsoluteLayout.LayoutBounds="0, 0, 1, 1"
            IsVisible="{TemplateBinding BindingContext.IsBusy, Converter={StaticResource NotConverter}}" />

        <ContentView
            AbsoluteLayout.LayoutFlags="All"
            AbsoluteLayout.LayoutBounds="0, 0, 1, 1"
            IsVisible="{TemplateBinding BindingContext.IsBusy}">
            
            <ActivityIndicator
                IsRunning="true"
                HorizontalOptions="Center"
                VerticalOptions="Center" />
            
        </ContentView>

    </AbsoluteLayout>
</ControlTemplate>
```

Another scenario where I found these quite useful's pages with custom nav bars â€”i.e. you don't want predefined OS one. Instead of stacking once and again your "CustomNavBarControl" it can be done just once, worrying on the actual changing content.
