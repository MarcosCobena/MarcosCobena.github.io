Hyde
----

A web site generator powered by Markdown which runs entirely in your browser.

You have [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) and, now, [Mr.
Hyde](https://github.com/MarcosCobena/marcoscobena.github.io) too —obviously you
get the joke.

How can I use it?
-----------------

1.  Clone <https://github.com/MarcosCobena/marcoscobena.github.io>, or simply
    fork it

2.  Delete my data for yours —mostly at
    [index.html](https://github.com/MarcosCobena/marcoscobena.github.io/blob/master/index.html)
    and [items.js]

3.  Go live!
