These Christmas holidays my computer-related hobby has been to write this thing
you’re reading right now: my new web, this web.

I had forgotten how much I enjoy writing JavaScript and felt WordPress was too
much for me (I was struggling deciding which theme was the one I truly wanted,
when what I really wanted was this).

My daily job is mostly iOS with Xamarin and C\# so coding something different
really enjoyed me.

My workmate [Oriol](http://www.oriolnoya.com) pointed me to [Derek
Sivers](https://sivers.org) world, which pushed my minimalist side a lot (I’m
also currently reading his Anything you want book).

Regarding how this web works, it’s just a single
[index.html](https://github.com/MarcosCobena/MarcosCobena.github.io/blob/master/index.html),
which pulls Markdown files -I’ve named those “items”- and lets you navigate
between them with user-friendly URLs. No server code, everything runs in client
side. Minimalist as I like :-)

I remembered had set up long time ago a github.io site, so I forwarded
marcoscobena.com to such, with a free DNS hosting service, allowing me to easily
push new items here without handling with FTP, SSH or similar.

I don’t really feel comfortable having my website in GitHub, call me vintage,
but it’s fine for now. I can easily move it anywhere else if I want to in a
future.
