One of the much things you learn when work with different people’s how they
handle those same things you work on. A few weeks ago I spent two or three days
on a Forms app where styles were pretty much taken into serious consideration,
from my point of view.

I loved how they were handling font-related stuff that have started applying
that approach in mine. It’s quite simple, i.e.:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    <Style x:Key="16FontStyle" TargetType="Label">
        <Setter Property="FontSize" Value="16" />
    </Style>

    <Style 
        x:Key="16BoldFontStyle" 
        BasedOn="{StaticResource 16FontStyle}" 
        TargetType="Label">
        <Setter Property="FontAttributes" Value="Bold" />
    </Style>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 

Every `Label` consumes these sort of styles. And one of the following tasks have
to work on is replacing the font family, but only have to do that change in a
single place. The same, increasing globally the font size because it feels too
small in some devices.

How do you handle these things? Have a different approach which feel really
work? I’m sure there’s still plenty of space to grow. Thanks in advance if you
share anything!
