I have learnt it is way better to close logic before design when you are about to start a task.

Imagine you need to create a log-in page. If you start laying the design out, it is possible to run out of time —from the estimation— and still the functionality is missing. If an user would need to use it, it is simply not there. However, if you start with logic and, run out of time, the user at least can solve her need, although it is not the most beautiful log-in she has seen. Both can then decide whether to invest some more time.

Fist logic, business needs, Acceptance Criteria, functionality; second design, layout, style. Form follows function, not the other way around.
