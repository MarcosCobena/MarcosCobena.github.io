Appart from my day-to-day job with the Xamarin Team, I spend a few hours per week collaborating with small tasks of [Wave Engine](http://waveengine.net/). It is our 2D/3D cross-platform game engine, written and coded in .NET/C#, which targets all those mobile devices you have in mind (running on Android and iOS through Xamarin products). And, it is free. [youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvTzWrJltQU] When I was reading Adam Wolf's [post](https://www.syntaxismyui.com/the-xamarin-forms-chef/) summarizing his recipes for Xamarin.Forms (thank you Master Chef!), I came up with the idea of doing the same, but with those I have been lately writting for Wave Engine. We are currently hosting those at the official Wave Engine's [GitHub account](https://github.com/WaveEngine/), at the Documentation repository's [Wiki](https://github.com/WaveEngine/Documentation/wiki), so anyone can help us to improve them:

Also, for those doing the first steps, the [Getting Started](https://github.com/WaveEngine/Documentation/wiki/Getting-Started) section can be quite helpful. Enjoy them!
