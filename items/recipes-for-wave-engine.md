Appart from my day-to-day job with the Xamarin Team, I spend a few hours per week collaborating with small tasks of <a href="http://waveengine.net/">Wave Engine</a>. It is our 2D/3D cross-platform game engine, written and coded in .NET/C#, which targets all those mobile devices you have in mind (running on Android and iOS through Xamarin products). And, it is free. [![](https://img.youtube.com/vi/DvTzWrJltQU/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvTzWrJltQU) When I was reading Adam Wolf's <a href="https://www.syntaxismyui.com/the-xamarin-forms-chef/">post</a> summarizing his recipes for Xamarin.Forms (thank youÂ Master Chef!), I came up with the idea of doing the same, but with those I have been lately writting for Wave Engine. We are currently hosting those at the official Wave Engine's <a href="https://github.com/WaveEngine/">GitHub account</a>, at the Documentation repository's <a href="https://github.com/WaveEngine/Documentation/wiki">Wiki</a>, so anyone can help us to improve them:
