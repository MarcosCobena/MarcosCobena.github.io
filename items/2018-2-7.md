I’ve been working on a screen playing with NFC discoveral, and have used for the
very first time NFCForms plug-in. It’s nice because avoids all the boilerplate
code needed to setup NFC, and gives back a few events to notice when tags are
coming in.

Such returns ids in a `byte[]` forms, where each position represents 2 hex.
chars. How to covert it to a more convenient string?

`var​ nfcTag = BitConverter.ToString(bytes).Replace("-", string.Empty);`

I learnt that from [this
thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/623104/byte-to-hex-string).

Since we consume a REST API and wanted to make some tests with a wrist-band we
have here at the office, my mate Sergio pointed me to capture the JSON payloads,
save it within the project and reproduce calls with a fake service, where [this
method](https://stackoverflow.com/a/34356170) is sooo handy for reading from
embedded resources.

Maybe this’ so simple but have read a little bit on how this op. works:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    if (items?.FirstOrDefault() == null)
    { […] }
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The operator `?.` —inside
[null-conditional](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/operators/null-conditional-operators)
set— returns the right side of the expression if left isn’t `null`, or `null`
otherwise, so the chain with `==` fits perfect in this case.
