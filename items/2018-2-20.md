It may sound strange but today’s been my welcome into using SVGs in
Xamarin.Forms, and FFImageLoading’s helped a lot —have some mates here which are
already heavily using it.

If you’re in the same position as me, read
[this](https://github.com/luberda-molinet/FFImageLoading/wiki/SVG-support)
before going on, as needs some setup. I experienced the same issue as [this
user](https://github.com/luberda-molinet/FFImageLoading/issues/914) but ended up
sorting it out —read my comment at bottom.

Honestly, I think will try to, from today, add every asset as SVG since Zeplin,
for instance, supports that export option, and you avoid messing with Android’s
densities, iOS' `@Nx`, etc.; giving our users the best result in their screens.

The only thing which worries me’s that FFImageLoading depends on SkiaSharp for
drawing SVGs, and read some months ago each time you work with a Skia’s canvas
the amount of memory reserved corresponds to a bitmap of screen size. But
probably FFImageLoading already handles this.

In other aspects, at the end of the day committed my changes, and pushed them,
buuut discovered a bug I introduced with a few files changed. After reverting
that commit for two (2) times, discovered you can cherry-pick a commit and don’t
commit it back again, but leave it at staging, so you simply can reset here and
there:

`git cherry-pick -n PROBLEMATIC_COMMIT_HASH`
