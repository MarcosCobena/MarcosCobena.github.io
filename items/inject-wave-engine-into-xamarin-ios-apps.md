My good friend and workmate <a href="https://twitter.com/sescaladab">Sergio Escalada</a> and I wrote a few months ago a quick guide, along with a sample (find the link below), on how you can render Wave Engine on a Xamarin.iOS app: not a full-screen game it-self, but adding specific views which are handled from Wave Engine.

Today, we've updated the article and sample app, because since Wave Engine v. 2.1.0 it's much more easier to accomplish this:

*A GIF nowadays is worth a thousand words*

It opens a new world of chances, like creating custom CAD apps, or playing with AR, for instance. We hope our users, <em>you</em>, will take this and make wonderful things. Don't forget to please share those with all of us!

PS: I'll be at Xamarin Evolve next week, so we can discuss this topic if you're attending as well! :-)
