My good friend and workmate [Sergio Escalada](https://twitter.com/sescaladab) and I wrote a few months ago a quick guide, along with a sample (find the link below), on how you can render Wave Engine on a Xamarin.iOS app: not a full-screen game it-self, but adding specific views which are handled from Wave Engine.
