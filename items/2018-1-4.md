I’m working on a video-game. Actually have been working on it since Christmas
began. I think will keep posting details mostly during weekends —have an
agreement with my-self of not working on anything which could do in my daily
job.

However, today I came across [this promising
video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lql2yFXzKUs) on creating Adventure Games
in Clojure (OK, you already know what sort of game it's), and a light turned on
in my head: I need something like scripting.

Since am on an early stage and just have a quite small prototype, am in the
process of rewriting it with a brand new script-alike description: each
`GameFrame` now has a `Script` prop. which allows to do things like:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    Script = new Task(async () =>
    {
        await Show("Suena la alarma: 7:00 am.");
        
        while (timesAlarmSnoozed < 3)
        {
            await InteractionWith(alarmClock);
            timesAlarmSnoozed++;
        }

        await Show("Me levanté...");
    });
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A few hours before I couldn’t handle this sort of logic, just more simpler ones.
Now, am thrilled with the incoming possibilities this’ offering 🤘
