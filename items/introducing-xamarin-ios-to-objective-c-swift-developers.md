A few months ago I had the chance to showcase [Xamarin.iOS](https://www.xamarin.com/platform) to pure Objective-C/Swift developers, within a local group called [NSCoder Sevilla](http://nscoder-sev.tumblr.com/).

Instead of making slides I thought it'd be more interesting to build a small app which'd do the same, as well as serving as a playground to showcase some topics: managed vs. native call stacks, [Xamarin.Forms](https://www.xamarin.com/forms), [Xamarin Workbooks](https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/cross-platform/workbooks/) ([Inspector mode](https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/cross-platform/inspector/)), etc. I think the most interesting piece for them was inspecting the app in real time with this last one.

The full codebase can be found [here](https://github.com/MarcosCobena/MicrosoftXamarinLoveiOS). It may be interesting as well for anyone who's invited to a similar scenario :-)
