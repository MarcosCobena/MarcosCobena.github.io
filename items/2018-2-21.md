Today I’ve started to help in a new project where Design is quite strict —which
I like 🤘

Cloning the repo, it’s set up with Git-LFS and I moved to SSH keys a month ago
or so. However, [LFS only works through
HTTPS](https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/issues/2186) so back to alternate
credentials. All of this within Visual Studio Team Services.

The screen am working on starts with a carousel —a carousel!— and
[CarouselView](https://github.com/alexrainman/CarouselView) fits perfectly. I’ve
only missed properties to customize its page selectors’ margin, but it’s not so
so important.

What I can’t believe is how the hell have lived without this Chrome shortcut
—guess can be replicated in any other browser too:

Instead of typing once and again “xamarin.forms “ and whatever now simply “xf” +
TAB and whatever. I’m so proud of this 🤠

Finally, I’ve tried `RelativeLayout` once again buuut keep thinking’s somewhat
useless when things can grow up hor. or ver. (i.e. a `Label` with +1 line). Know
could do it by code, but after using LiveXAML’s difficult to switch back 🤷‍♂️
