 

Having Valentine’s Day so close in date, today I’ve felt in love with
ValueTuples. Why you would say: because it allowed me to super super easy build
models to wire up with the UI, something like:

`return new (Title: $”Action {index + 1}”, Exercise: currentExercise,
ValidatedSession: currentValidatedSession);`

Already “old” Tuples were doing a great job for me, because even `Item1`, etc.
was feeling ugly when binding in XAML, it still was allowing me go fast
iterating. But discovered that beautiful naming in ValueTuples and moved on.

However, Xamarin.Forms’ XAML currently doesn’t support referencing a named
property from ValueTuples —I guess it comes from XAMLC phase. So had to finally
create some models and work with them from that on.

My question is:

Oh, and [found a bug](https://github.com/xamarin/Xamarin.Forms/issues/1891) with
DataTriggers which cannot reference an enum value.

And another one, [already
filled](https://bugzilla.xamarin.com/show_bug.cgi?id=59448), where
`IsClippedToBounds` doesn’t work with Fast Renderers.

We could say it’s been a buggy day.
