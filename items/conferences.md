*Nos debería preocupar más el diseño que el código*
---------------------------------------------------

“Design should worry us more than code”, translated to English. My vision on how
working close to people highly capable in Design made me change the focus from
code to UI/UX, everything focused in the Xamarin ecosystem. (YouTube:

Expand your skills with Xamarin: from native to cross-platform
--------------------------------------------------------------

In a pure iOS event, my workmate Oriol and I thought Xamarin could leverage them
chances to go cross-platform. We showcased such ways, and built a small agenda
app to demonstrate all these. ([GitHub](https://github.com/DevsDNA/NSSpain2017):

*Missing anything?*
-------------------

I’ve enjoyed spreading knowledge since was attending the University –mostly .NET
and Xamarin, but also other topics–, so feel free to ping me if want to list
here any of my talks from previous years. I’ll try to do my best! Thanks in
advance.
