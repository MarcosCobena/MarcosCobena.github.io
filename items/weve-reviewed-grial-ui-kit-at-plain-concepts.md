Our workmate Juan Antonio Cano (<a href="https://twitter.com/jacano35">@jacano35</a>) has done a great review of this fantastic kit for Xamarin.Forms. We'd like to thank the guys from <a href="http://www.uxdivers.com/">UXDivers</a> for sharing a license with us, so we could analyze it deeply. Enjoy it!

A few weeks ago we got access to the Regular version of Grial UIKit for Xamarin.Forms. Grial UIKit comes with more than 30 awesome Xamarin.Forms’ XAML screens which showcase this Xamarin Component, as well as, support for customization capabilities of Xamarin default controls, providing and unified Grial Theme that looks and feels great on every platform.

<h2><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>
Here, in Plain Concepts, we are always eager to leverage every platform in which we develop our apps for.

We try to know as close as we could the strengths and weaknesses of the native UI frameworks of our platform apps, its customization capabilities, etc…

That’s the reason why Grial UIKit grabbed our attention, so I decided to analize it from the following perspectives:
<ul>
	<li>Size</li>
	<li>Dependencies</li>
	<li>Number of controls and screens</li>
	<li>Degrees of freedom when it comes to customization</li>
	<li>Performance</li>
	<li>Animations</li>
	<li>Binding support and MVVM design</li>
	<li>Multiplatform suport</li>
</ul>
Let’s start with it.
