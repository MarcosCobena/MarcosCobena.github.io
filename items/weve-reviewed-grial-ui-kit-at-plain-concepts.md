Our workmate Juan Antonio Cano ([@jacano35](https://twitter.com/jacano35)) has done a great review of this fantastic kit for Xamarin.Forms. We'd like to thank the guys from [UXDivers](http://www.uxdivers.com/) for sharing a license with us, so we could analyze it deeply. Enjoy it!

Grial UIKit comes with more than 30 awesome Xamarin.Forms' XAML screens which showcase this Xamarin Component, as well as, support for customization capabilities of Xamarin default controls, providing and unified Grial Theme that looks and feels great on every platform.
