It's close to 24:00 and I've just arrived to the hotel after spending a wonderful day at #dotNetSpain2016. However, I couldn't go to bed without writting down how much I value the acquisition of Xamarin from Microsoft.

I grew up with my father sharing with me his love for Microsoft. Love in terms of excitement on how this company was changing our lifes in '90s. My dream during childhood was to work with them. It was to join Microsoft and push my pixel in empowering people. The dream came true in my early 20s.

During such decade I discovered Mono Project. My first lines with C# were making small GUI demos for Gnome 2 using .NET bindings. And I could reuse my code on Windows as well. Mind blowing.&nbsp;

Eventually Mono "became" Xamarin, and made mobile development a joy; where I can actually discuss with a Java Android developer whether calling Set() or SetExact() in AlarmManager is feasible in Android &lt;5; or even share AutoLayout tips with an Objective-C/Swift iOS developer in a same level basis. Or develop a game engine such like Wave Engine to assure people can tell stories though video-games on as much platforms as possible. But I keep  still with C# in the end.

And today Microsoft acquires Xamarin. It's like the best father in the world for the son you're aware has an incredible intelligence, thus you feel in the need of protecting him to assure gives his best to everyone around.&nbsp;

I'm quite happy. And strongly think fantastic years are to come for us at Plain Concepts and the Xamarin community. Congratulations to everyone who has made this happen. Really motivating shift guys, really motivating shift. Like in '90s revolution it was all about the PC, nowadays it's all about mobile devices. And C# will keep with me a few years more on all of those.&nbsp;
