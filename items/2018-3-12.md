Hmm, when I’ve gone to locally debug my ASP.NET site which provides the API to
my app, a got an alert saying something like We couldn’t connect to the local
IIS Express server. Luckily,
[StackOverflow’s](https://stackoverflow.com/a/36801686) always there when you
need it. I’d just add needed to run VS as Admin.

Most of my day has consisted on writing SQL queries to build a new scenario
within our app, and I’ve missed a looot a way of friendly writing this in Excel
maybe? but having the SQL back for “free”. Any ideas on existing stuff is
reaaally welcomed.
