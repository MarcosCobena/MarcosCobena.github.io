Going back from past dotNet Conference Spain 2015, <a href="https://twitter.com/jsuarezruiz" target="_blank">Javier Suárez</a> and I shared our passion on Xamarin at the train's cafeteria. We both liked the idea of having a local user group where talking about our projects made with Xamarin, which are the latest news, meet some other people doing the same things, etc.

Today I would like to introduce <a href="http://www.meetup.com/SevillaXamarinDevelopers/" target="_blank">Sevilla Xamarin Developer Group</a>, specially our <a href="http://www.meetup.com/SevillaXamarinDevelopers/events/222107171/" target="_blank">first meetup</a>, this following Wednesday 6th. We will have people who are landing from Build 2015, and it is thrilling for me to chat with those since the past days have been quite interesting for cross-platform mobile developers.
