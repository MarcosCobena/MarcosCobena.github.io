*[Creativity, Inc.: overcoming the unseen forces that stand in the way of true inspiration](https://archive.org/details/creativityincove0000catm/)*

I have read it as a Software Engineer, a programmer, convinced there are still plenty of problems to solve in our daily job. Also, as that boy who still remembers how was the day I watched Toy Story for the first time.

Like them (Pixar), the software it-self is not the primary value, but what it actually generates on people who use it. They look for making people happier with their stories, we look for solving people's problems with our products, thus making them happier. And we are more or less good solving things inside the computer; however, we lack knowledge to solve those out of it.

It has been trully inspiring for me. And, at the end, there is a beautiful gift for those who appreaciate Steve Jobs —and have read a few of his biographies.
