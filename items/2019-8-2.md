Today we've reached a mid-term goal with our port of Wave Engine to WebGL: "every" visual test we agreed is currently
running —between quotes because the stencil one actually doesn't, and we need to go for a second round as we enabled
texture storage in the middle.

This' for instance the last one:

At the beginning of the week I worked on passing a ReadOnlySpan&lt;byte&gt; to a few WebGL calls —as Juan recommended us
through Twitter. I started touching the transpiler, WebIDLToCSharp, but quickly noticed it wasn't worth as needs a
somewhat big change while such can be done at the backend side. Also, I'm not 100% sure will find any other approach
which's still better in performance.

With the last visual test we've gotten ~30 fps so thinking on AOT is becoming a must. I'd like to research on this
sooner or later.
