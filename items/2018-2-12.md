Today I’ve been working on a XAML page and, again, have needed some fake data to
populate a `ListView`’s `ItemsSource`. A trick I find so useful for that,
without building custom models which represent’s Design copies, is to simply
bind an array of n items:

-   within your ViewModel — here for instance 3:

`public IEnumerable<int> FakeData => Enumerable.Range(0, 3);`

-   within your `Page`:

`&lt;ListView ItemsSource="{Binding FakeData}" [...]`

Now I can concentrate on the item template without putting so much effort on the
temporal fake data.
