Today I’ve needed to debug how our DB is physically created —tables and PKs— and
Pulido (thanks man!) told me to enable tracing so every query gets printed (we
found it
[here](http://igrali.com/2015/03/12/output-sqlite-queries-using-sqlite-net-in-universal-apps/)):

`connection = new SQLiteAsyncConnection(DatabasePath) { Trace = true };`

Our app uses Material Design card views here and there, and we already have a
custom `Frame` which disables shadows on iOS because of default ones are quite
dark and wide. Between

last one on applying shadows to `UIView` we got almost identical shadows on both
platforms. Yeah!
