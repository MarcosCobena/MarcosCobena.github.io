Back from Christmas holidays with a cool task! Yeray asked me to play with
native Spotify SDKs ðŸ˜™ Looking for a little bit it turns out Aaron Bockover
â€”this resembled me past days of Gnomeâ€™s Bansheeâ€” [had already
done](https://github.com/abock/spotify-ios-sdk/tree/master/Xamarin) the initial
steps for iOS one, so took his job and continued it a little bit up to
initializing Spotifyâ€™s authentication all from Xamarin.iOS ðŸ˜‡

Iâ€™ve spent the afternoon giving some love to our
[DevsDNA.GradientBoxView](https://github.com/DevsDNA/GradientBoxView) control,
adding UWP support. Got it working in the end, but [filled a
bug](https://github.com/xamarin/Xamarin.Forms/issues/1530) because
Xamarin.Formsâ€™ Custom Renderers seem to not work from a third library.

Nowadays I almost donâ€™t open Visual Studio in Windows and had to work with its
2017 version for that UWP piece, and had the feeling after a few hours my
experience was buggy: donâ€™t know why but the UWP lib. lost its references to
Xamarin.Forms NuGet package, updating such back and forth made the build to
break (restarting fixed it however), and saw my-self closing and opening it once
and again. I feel Mac version is more stable in terms of Xamarin development,
but am not a heavy Windows user these days.

Pst! Donâ€™t want to say it louder, but you can use below comments already ðŸ™Œ
