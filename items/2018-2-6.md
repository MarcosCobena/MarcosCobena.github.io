I’m back to Plain Concepts, and have joined a beautiful Xamarin.Forms project.

Asking the Designer for some info on a screen discovered how to capture a
screenshot and copy it directly into the clipboard in macOS:

`CMD` + `CTRL` + `MAY` + `4`

Very funny to press with a single hand.

Those assets was asking for needed a small tweak to turn one color into another
one, in order to compose an animation, and GIMP’s been there to the rescue
again:
