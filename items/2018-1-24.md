### MAP_JIT error when launching a Xamarin.iOS app

My coworker Marcos Antonio's having an issue with a Xamarin.iOS app closing at
start-up running in Release on an iPod Touch, so we made pair debugging
together. What the device output pad shows at VS for Mac is this error:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
System Policy: MAP_JIT requires the dynamic-codesigning entitlement
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the beginning, reading JIT recalls AOT’s not disabled. However, it’s, so we
go through the Devices window within Xcode and discover the actual issue going
down the log: Rx’s `SystemClock` is throwing a `NullReferenceException`.

After some time debugging, aligning Rx packages from core project to iOS one, we
discovered that as soon as you avoid any code regarding ReactiveUI —in our case—
the app starts. So, our assumption comes from Rx trying to be initialized before
time.

How to fix this? We currently have no solution, but reading along Xamarin’s
Forums, Stack Overflow and so on, if you experience a MAP_JIT issue we can say
that’s not the actual issue, so go back to raw logs and keep looking for a
managed stack trace, which surely there it’ll be waiting for care.

### SSH keys (part III/n)

I’ve discovered my issues with SSH keys isn’t macOS being updated but a computer
restart. Calling `ssh-add` acts on the current SSH agent running, but doesn’t
persist over restarts. Think will automate it in any way.
