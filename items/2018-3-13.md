Today I’ve finally deployed every NFC tag within our office to actual test the
app. Independently on what our apps are all about, it reaaally helps a lot to
put your-self in the user’s perspective. I mean not only using the app on a real
device with a fake user or with fake data, but having to solve a real goal.

It’s funny because this’ not a common scenario have found out within the last
years developing apps, sometimes because of our side —simply there’s no trigger
to do that—, sometimes because of the business in place —working on a bank app
you cannot real test it so easily, you know.

However, today I’ve felt it’s actually another face of the polygon we,
developers, need to put care on: pushing our customers to prepare the field to
move us a little bit more inside too, and pushing our-selves to see the value of
doing this, even it’s another time-consuming point.
