My current project involves an ASP.NET server side with both a small web and its
API. I needed to debug things locally to go faster, thus wanted to connect my
app in macOS to the API in my virtualized Windows 10. In order to access such
endpoint
[this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35247847/bad-request-invalid-hostname-asp-net-visual-studio-2015/41895739)
article helped quite a lot.

Just would like to highlight some small details, which made me got it working:

1.  The applicationhost.config file isnâ€™t the one located under `Program
    Files\Blablabla`, but inside the solution root: for instance,
    `C:\Users\Marcos\Repositorios\MyProject\src\.vs\config`

2.  The correct binding which worked for me is as follows:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    <site name="..." id="2">
        <application path="/" applicationPool="Clr4IntegratedAppPool">
            <virtualDirectory path="/" physicalPath="C:\Users\Marcos\Repositorios\MyProject\src\MyProjectServer\MyProjectApi" />
        </application>
        <bindings>
            <binding protocol="http" bindingInformation="*:53034:localhost" />
            <!-- This one! -->
            <binding protocol="http" bindingInformation="10.4.1.51:53034:*" />
        </bindings>
    </site>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

3.  If you want to connect to the attached SQL Server DB â€”as for connecting with
    Management Studio:

    1.  this command tells which instance I have in my machine:

        `C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\130\Tools\Binn>SqlLocalDB.exe
        info`

    2.  and this whether my instance is on or off:

        `C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\130\Tools\Binn>SqlLocalDB.exe
        info MSSQLLocalDB`

Finally, Stephane Delcroix replied to my post at Planet Xamarinâ€™s Twitter
account with a [PR](https://github.com/xamarin/Xamarin.Forms/pull/1317), already
merged, where he adds ValueTuples support to Xamarin.Forms! Thanks Stephane ðŸ˜‡
