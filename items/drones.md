After some time with the *fly* behind the ear I’ve joined this thrilling hobby.
It blends the build stuff aspect I really love and actually flying which who in
earth doesn’t like :-)

**Current status**

I’ve flied my first time with below customized Syma X5C. Although it was a
little bit windy I really enjoyed it, and camera + VR006 goggles have made a
decent job. After hitting ground a few times the video signal started to have
some interferences, but I need to debug it. My next steps are:

-   Make X5C’s Tx support neck cords, reusing those I already have from
    conferences or similar

-   Improve my flying abilities 1) outdoor by going out more frequently with X5C
    and 2) indoor with E013 —which I only have 1 battery but won’t increase it
    until decide whether I jump into Betaflight world

-   Improve X5C camera attachment looking for more protection and better angle

### Syma X5C-1

![](items/images/SymaX5C-1.jpg)

This’ my Hello World with drones. After much reading for a good starter kit
decided to buy one with thoughts of customizing it after. I’ve already tried to
change its frame into a cardboard Tiny Whoop but, obviously, there are leaks
everywhere. The good thing’s I removed every useless piece so gained a few grams
for flying.

-   Removed every possible piece attached to the frame: propellers protectors,
    undercarriage, included bottom camera along with battery door, four included
    LEDs (although less noticeable, the entire frame’s linked with just 2 x 4
    screws, such pairs below each propeller, and 2 more at center diagonal)

-   Added [Eachine E013’s
    camera](https://www.banggood.com/5_8G-40CH-1000TVL-13-CMOS-Camera-For-Eachine-E013-RC-Quadcopter-Spare-Parts-p-1221410.html)
    reusing built-in’s wires and connector: **IMPORTANT**: had to exchange red
    and black wires from the PCB previously

### Eachine E013 (with goggles)

After realizing X5C wasn’t good for indoor flying and transforming it into a FPV
kit was going to be more expensive than buying this other kit, acquired one of
these with camera and goggles.
