One aspect that Apple pushed to the limits is the union between Designers and Developers. Instead of understanding the product development process as a chain, it is done as a very close relationship walking in the same direction. Both of them speak different languages: they use different tools during their day-to-day job, they see different aspects of the product, their definition of done is different, etc.

But there is something in common, which turns out to be a quite important thing: both want the product to succeed. Both want to deliver the best shape of what they are working on, and want to exceed the customer's expectations. Thus, it is worth looking for ways to improve this beautiful marriage.

Within the following paragraphs, we will cover how to translate design sizes into numbers which can be written directly into the UI designers (Xamarin's one for Android and iOS, and Microsoft's one for Windows Phone). Even for Xamarin.Forms' XAML. Building UI layouts takes a large amount of time of the development process, and we have found quite helpful at <a href="http://www.plainconcepts.com/"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Plain Concepts</span></a> to accelerate this task.
