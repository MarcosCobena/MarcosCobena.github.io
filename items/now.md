I’m in a team of 2 working on [Beezy for
Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.beezy.store&hl=es),
reaching feature complete to align with its [iOS
version](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/beezy-mobile/id1139620867?mt=8). Built
with MvvmCross, it bundles custom auth against SharePoint (both Office 365 and
on-premise), manages storage through Akavache (✈️ mode!) and leverages the best
UI/UX I’ve ever built –mostly thanks to [Iban](http://www.ibanbeldarrain.com),
our wonderful Designer.

Back after holidays to [Graphic
Design](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/graphic-design) specialization.
Also practicing with with Real World™ small projects: gift cards, CVs, etc.
