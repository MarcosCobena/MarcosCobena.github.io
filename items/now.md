I’m focused in Mobile Development, through Xamarin, with accent in UX aspects. I
spend most of my time in Xamarin.iOS apps, helped by MVVMCross; from time to
time I visit customers to teach Xamarin-related topics: Xamarin.iOS, Android,
Forms, HockeyApp, Test Cloud, DevOps in general, etc. I enjoy that educational
side of my job, and do my best to translate how much value have mobile apps for
me.

Every week I write down in this site what I learned the past one, related to my
daily job. The main motivation here is to keep English fresh in my mind, but
also share things I discover or learn which can be helpful for others as well.

I’ve started a newsletter (in Spanish) to share thoughts or points of view I
have on life things. Things that have helped in my own life which may be of
interest for anyone else. You can subscribe [here](#/home).
