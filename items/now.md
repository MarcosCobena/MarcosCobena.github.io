I’m working on [Beezy for
Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.beezy.store&hl=es),
reaching feature complete to align with its [iOS
version](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/beezy-mobile/id1139620867?mt=8); from
time to time I visit customers to teach Xamarin-related topics: Xamarin.iOS,
Android, Forms, HockeyApp, Test Cloud, DevOps in general, etc. I enjoy that
educational side of my job, and do my best to translate how much value have
mobile apps for me.

Before summer I started to study [Graphic
Design](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/graphic-design) as a side
project, achieving the first two grades in the specialization of five. I’m back
after holidays to this and would like to finish the other three before the end
of year. I committed to Gimp and Inkscape as my main tools during the entire
course and also practice with them with small projects (gift cards, CVs, etc.)
Graphic Design is something I’m truly enjoying.
