Approximately one month ago I joined a new Xamarin.Forms app â€“Android & iOSâ€“ for
the flight company Avianca (itâ€™s not the users one, but for employees). Made
upon ReactiveUI, bundles Lottie animations and plenty of custom controls â€“for
instance, I particularly made a carousel one of which am really proud ðŸ¤“

Back in October I completed the third course in the [Graphic
Design](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/graphic-design) specialization,
and have decided to pause it a little bit while enjoy some other programming
things.
