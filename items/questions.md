Nowadays I have super quick access to answers for anything I’d need developing
apps; however, quality uses to come when I put my-self into different questions.
Because of this, I’m starting to write all those questions down, organized by
areas, curious whether anyone out there also shares the same perception.

How an app can be opened
------------------------

Apps can be started from a bunch of different ways, or states, and paying
attention to the details’s key to cover any combination our users can take.

-   Are you sure the app starts in the same way when it’s in background and you
    tap its icon, and tapping it in the OS’ history — iOS’ double tap to Home
    button, for instance?

-   If your app receives Push Notifications, what happens when users tap in the
    alert? Where does the app need to navigate? If your app needs to log in, how
    do you handle if the last one expired?

-   If you’re showing a permanent notification — running a foreground service,
    as Android names it — , what does it happen if you tap on it while the app
    is in background? Or foreground? Or even fully closed?
