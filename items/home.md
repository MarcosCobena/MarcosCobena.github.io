# Hi! My name is Marcos and I craft apps for people like you and me

It's actually Marcos CobeÃ±a MoriÃ¡n â€”CobeÃ±a for my [Dad](http://joseantoniocobena.com) and MoriÃ¡n for my Mom, so sometimes I just write them together to assure my Mom's doesn't get lost. I'm a Xamarin Software Developer located at Sevilla, south of Spain.

My beloved apps target mainly iOS and Android, using Xamarin. Most of my work's done nowadays with Xamarin.Forms, although still some customers need the classical approach â€”i.e. Xamarin.Android & iOS.

On late 2017 I started writing down what learn each day, motivated because of helping others and putting my English in practice â€”I copied in some way my friend aro's "Good morning!" picture. Almost every entry deals with Xamarin, but I touch some other stuff too.

    <select id="items"></select>

If you use Feedly, or any other aggregator, this [RSS](feed.rss)' what you're looking for â€”it has everything, categorized. However, if you just want my diary on Xamarin, I'm listed at Planet Xamarin as well, so just follow it and done:

        <img alt="Featured at Planet Xamarin!" src="https://www.planetxamarin.com/Content/img/planetxamarin-featured-badge.png" width="150" />
    </a>
</div>

From time to time I like to spend [conferences](#/conferences) in different places: national congresses, local user groups and universities, among other ones. It's a great chance to see other's point of view, quite needed in order to improve one-self.

# I love to build things

I like too much computers from the chance they provide to create stuff. Seriously. My grandfather made wood toys for me when I was a child, but was limited by the material, and tools needed. With computers this doesn't happen, so I feel have endless possibilities.

These are just a few examples:

# How you can contact me

Call me old but I still see e-mail as the most reliable channel, so *try to* keep up with it in a daily basis. It's always called my attention how writing to quite known people from software industry I always get a reply. It's a signal of gratitude, and I love it!

I'd say [Twitter](https://twitter.com/1Marcos2Cobena) is the one consume most. With years think have found a healthy way to work with it, focusing on a small amount of people to follow which are actual friends or share interesting stuff for me. Following just a bunch of users â€”try to stick with less than one hundredâ€” makes pull-to-refresh almost useless, which recalls a warning in my head to not become so much addicted.

I'm devoting my career to Software Development sooo [GitHub](https://github.com/MarcosCobena)'s a must for me. I see it as some sort of Labs place â€”companies in the early 2000s used to have Labs branches where played with new stuff. C# keeps being my most used language, although I maintain my love for JavaScript since when started to code.

And I have [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/MarcosCobena) too, mostly to keep record of my CV.

Actually I use to sign up with "MarcosCobena" in every place â€”but Twitter, where messed my account up and had to move to current "1Marcos2Cobena" (yeah, quite creative, I know).

# You reached the end!

Wow, you went through everything above, thanks so much for visiting me. I'd really like to hear from you if work on similar stuff, or want to tell me a better way to do this or that, or just found a typo. I *promise* will reply.
