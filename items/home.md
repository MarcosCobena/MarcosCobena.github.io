*¡Hola!*

This' Marcos, a Software Development Engineer from west Europe. Nowadays, I work at [Plain Concepts](http://www.plainconcepts.com) building apps with [Xamarin](http://www.xamarin.com), and developing small pieces for [Wave Engine](http://www.waveengine.net). I'm also interested in Graphic Design, and rely in [Gimp](http://www.gimp.org) and [Inkscape](http://inkscape.org) for anything related.

On 2018 I recorded some audios with my mobile phone, thinking they'd serve to focus while working:

- *Queso parmesano* (April 2018), while eating at an italian restaurant

- *Viento y pájaros* (May 2018), while eating with my girlfriend in the middle of the forest
