Working on our own lib. to bundle all that stuff we usually need on each project
I stumbled upon one issue when creating the unit testing project: VS for Mac
doesn't detect Unit Tests from .NET Standard libraries, independent of the NUnit
version used —2.x to 3.x. F\*\*k!

After trying with newer and older NUnit versions finally had no other way than
going back to a common .NET lib., actually the project type suggested within VS.

Fully embracing .NET Standard from the perspective of a macOS user’s somewhat
like a pain nowadays...

On other aspects, I finally found a quick solution to avoid a specific StyleCop
rule within one of our projects —we have a global StyleCop.Settings file at our
solution root. Simply add a similar file *in your project root* knowing that
will be load just after the global one, so freely disable that what you want:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    <StyleCopSettings Version="105">
      <Analyzers>
        <Analyzer AnalyzerId="StyleCop.CSharp.DocumentationRules">
          <Rules>
            <Rule Name="ElementsMustBeDocumented">
              <RuleSettings>
                <BooleanProperty Name="Enabled">False</BooleanProperty>
              </RuleSettings>
            </Rule>
          </Rules>
        </Analyzer>
      </Analyzers>
    </StyleCopSettings>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 

That sort of cascade loading resembled to GAC priorities when loading assemblies
back in 2000s —am getting old, I know.

I got to this from [this](https://stackoverflow.com/a/3296152) Stack Overflow
thread.

Also I’m trying to learn in those free mins. which are the “new” C\# 7 features
I could actually use in my daily routine, and this’ the one I’m more enjoying
actually:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    var number = 42;

    if (number is int integer)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"It's an integer! {integer}");
    }
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 

How much time I’d have spent casting number to int, and accessing it after… And
how elegant’s this solution now 😍

If you want “the link” for those features go

Welcome!
