Today I’ve doing a variety of things from contacting one of our customers,
estimating an incoming project tooo actually work on a task from the first one.

Basically needed to add a sort of loading state to a summary view which pulls
the results from the API, thus we don’t want success/failure banners to show
before, mostly to avoid a heart attach in our users.

[One month ago](/?i=2018-2-8) I wrote down my own version of a "Visual State"
management which, from my point of view, simplifies the known version from
WPF/Windows 8 aaand gives fine control over the storyboard to execute,
everything with a minimal footprint and already usable on current Xamarin.Forms
stable version.

So have done the fade in using above stuff, and liked how it still feels
comfortable and solves the need quite well :-)
