*Pst!* I almost never work on projects alone; this' the result of a whole team effort:

### Tailwind Traders

![](items/images/TailwindTraders.png)

This year Microsoft Connect(); 2018 event presented Xamarin.Forms 4 cycle showcased through our Tailwind Traders app. Such was conceived from scratch and introduced Shell along with its fly-out menu. I'd highlight how much care we took into almost every aspect of the solution: enforced XAML policies, minimalistic MVVM framework, feature toggling through its settings, beautiful shadows, etc.

### Ges Seguros

For a new iteration over the existing app, I worked adding some more functionality. This project doesn't bundle a highly customized UI, but's pretty large in the amount of views. I've taken the chance to refactor mostly at XAML side: taking controls out to avoid repetition, establishing bases for fonts styles, etc. I was in charge too of recovering the CI/CD environment, layed in App Center.

### Snip Insights

![](items/images/SnipInsights.png)

Starting from [Microsoft Garage's original app](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/garage/profiles/snip-insights/), we developed a Xamarin.Forms port for macOS & Linux â€”and Windows too, although didn't use it finally because of a Gtk# bug with DPIs. The biggest challenge was to build a modern UI with Xamarin.Forms' Gtk# backend where there's no transparencies, for instance. I particularly enjoyed [workaround](https://gist.github.com/MarcosCobena/b4768bacc1a112a4f38a9d11a19f1251)ing a [crash](https://github.com/mono/gtk-sharp/issues/236) under macOS when taking screenshots, because had to bind some Apple's Core Graphics APIs, and glue this altogueter back to Gtk#.
