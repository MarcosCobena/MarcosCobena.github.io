Yesterday we had our customer at office in order to review how the project’s
going on. He told us which’s the final device our app will run on.

Creating a new emulator with Xamarin’s Android Devices gem —I’ve been using it
almost daily during the last months and works quite good & stable— I wanted to
set the most similar properties to the actual one, and with density didn’t
really know its value: however, knew the diagonal and screen size in px so [this
calculator](http://kingscalculator.com/en/other-calculators/pixel-density-calculator)
gave me the density.

In other aspects, I’ve been updating our database schema so had to work with
Entity Framework’s CLI, where my friend Sergio helped a lot: for the record,
these are the commands I used from PowerShell:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    PS YourCSProjInChargeOfDB> dotnet ef migrations list
    PS > dotnet ef migrations list --context AContext
    PS > dotnet ef migrations add ANewMigration
    PS > dotnet ef database update --context AContext
