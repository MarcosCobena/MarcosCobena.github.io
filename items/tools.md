Those I use to work with in my daily job, mostly while developing apps:

Â 

**Android File Transfer**Â â€”self-explanatory

<https://www.android.com/filetransfer/>

Â 

**BetterSnapTools** â€”I like a lot how Windows adapts such when taken into edges
and this makes exactly the same on macOS. Worth the price

<https://itunes.apple.com/es/app/bettersnaptool/id417375580?mt=12>

Â 

**Charles** â€”Fiddler for macOS: debug network connections, very useful when
struggling with HTTP calls from an app which doesnâ€™t work as expected

<https://www.charlesproxy.com>

Â 

**ColorSlurp** â€”`CMD` + `MAY` + `M` and youâ€™ll get a small magnifier which tells
the color in hex format. Not only itâ€™s handy for such, but also for aligning
things close in pixels

<https://itunes.apple.com/es/app/colorslurp/id1287239339?mt=12>

Â 

**Device Metrics**Â â€”idemÂ as (1)

<https://material.io/devices/>

Â 

**Disk Inventory X**Â â€”app to show a tree map with directories size, very handy
for debugging where the hell an app is taking so much space in disk

<http://www.derlien.com/>

Â 

**DPI love (1)**Â â€”which DPI a specific device has

<http://dpi.lv/>

Â 

**GIF speed changer** â€”when Designers send me GIFs to showcase what theyâ€™re
pretending I find really useful to decrease motion to perceive small details

<https://ezgif.com/speed/>

Â 

**gimp-android-xdpi**Â â€”plug-in to export current image into multiple Android
densities (Target DP Width is that which will have in mdpi)Â 

<https://github.com/ncornette/gimp-android-xdpi>

NOTE: in macOS, place the plug-in under `/Users/marcos/Library/Application
Support/GIMP/2.8/modules`.

Â 

**JSON Viewer** â€”a customer I was working with introduced me this wonderful one,
and like a lot because builds a tree view from any pasted payload, and even
formats it beautifully

<http://jsonviewer.stack.hu/>

Â 

**Lorem Pixel** â€”returns random images categorized through topics and sizes.
Quite useful when outlining UIs which have images. My fuchsia `BoxView`
replacement

<http://lorempixel.com/>

Â 

**SQLite Browser** â€”almost every app ends up with a local SQLite DB, and can
explore its content with it

<http://sqlitebrowser.org/>

Â 

**pidcat** â€”thereâ€™s no need to run Android Device Monitor for just logs, this
CLI tool makes a great job directly from the Terminal. Thanks to [Javi
Pulido](https://twitter.com/pulimento) who introduced me this.

<https://github.com/JakeWharton/pidcat>

NOTE: I had to add Androidâ€™s SDK to PATH manually:

`export
PATH=$PATH:/Users/marcos/Library/Developer/Xamarin/android-sdk-macosx/platform-tools`

`export
PATH=$PATH:/Users/marcos/Library/Developer/Xamarin/android-sdk-macosx/tools`

Â 

**VirtualBox** â€”the software I run to virtualize Windows under macOS. I keep
[here](https://medium.com/@MarcosCobena/tips-tricks-to-rely-in-virtualbox-e9e28c8cd180)
all those tips & tricks which make my experience smoother.

<https://www.virtualbox.org/>

Â 

**Vysor** â€”the best way I know to work as with an emulator but on an actual
Android device, worth purchasing

<https://www.vysor.io/>

Â 

### Visual Studio for Mac

If not said explicitly these are available through existing repositories at
Visual Studio \> Extensionsâ€¦ \> Gallery.

Â 

**ðŸ†• DeepClean (IDE extensions)** â€”not only deletes /bin & /obj folders but also
cleans NuGet caches

Â 

**ðŸ†• FiraCode** â€”an absolute joyful font with beautiful ligatures for things
like `=>`. Just choose it from VSâ€™ Preferences

<https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode>

Â 

**MS Solution Launcher** â€”multiple instances of Visual Studio at the same time

<https://github.com/Redth/MSSolutionLauncher>

Â 

**My custom key bindings** â€”after years using MonoDevelop, Xamarin Studio and
now Visual Studio for Mac, Iâ€™ve finally customized a few key bindings which find
very useful
