# Hyde ðŸ‘¹

A web site generator which runs entirely in your browser:
- Powered by HTML, CSS & JavaScript, super simple to maintain;
- You just write Markdown in your prefered editor ([Texts](http://www.texts.io/), for instance);
- With optional RSS feed generation through a .NET Core console app ([WIP](https://github.com/MarcosCobena/marcoscobena.github.io/blob/master/ItemsToRss/Program.cs))

You have [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) and, now, [Mr. Hyde](https://github.com/MarcosCobena/marcoscobena.github.io) too â€”obviously you get the joke.

# How can I use it?

1.  Clone <https://github.com/MarcosCobena/marcoscobena.github.io>, or simply fork it

2.  Delete my data for yours â€”mostly at [index.html](https://github.com/MarcosCobena/marcoscobena.github.io/blob/master/index.html) and [items.js](https://github.com/MarcosCobena/marcoscobena.github.io/blob/master/items/items.js)

3.  Go live!

# Could I contribute?

Yes, sure, I'd really appreciate it! Have a look to the [Backlog](https://github.com/MarcosCobena/marcoscobena.github.io/issues/1) to see what I'm currently in.
