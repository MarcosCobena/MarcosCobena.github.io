A web site generator which runs entirely in your browser:

-   Powered by HTML, CSS & JavaScript, super simple to maintain;

-   You just write Markdown in your preferred editor
    ([Texts](http://www.texts.io/), for instance);

-   Navigation handled through HTML's `pushState()`, heading to enable Google actually crawls this;

There are some other features which were available previously and still can be found in older commits, just ask and I'll glad help you find them:

-   Anyone can comment thanks to Disqus support;

-   Built-in RSS feed generation

You have [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) and, now, [Mr.
Hyde](https://github.com/MarcosCobena/marcoscobena.github.io) too â€”obviously you
get the joke.

How can I use it?
-----------------

1.  Clone <https://github.com/MarcosCobena/marcoscobena.github.io>, or simply
    fork it

2.  Delete my data for yours â€”mostly at
    [index.html](https://github.com/MarcosCobena/marcoscobena.github.io/blob/master/index.html)
    and
    [items.js](https://github.com/MarcosCobena/marcoscobena.github.io/blob/master/items/items.js)

3.  Go live!

Could I contribute?
-------------------

Yes, sure, I'd really appreciate it! However, I have no further expectations than spend a good time working on this to fit whichever need I may come up with. If this sounds good for you and have any change to share, please go ahead and send a PR.
